This zone is a personal quest area and should be treated with the same care and respect as any other quest-related activity.  The standard questing rules apply to this challenge, and anyone who breaks them will be dealt with harshly.  Please see Help Rules to refresh your memory before continuing onward.     Additional Bronze Expedition rules and clarifying statements:     1) You may not attempt the Expedition if you are not within the required       level range (28-35).  If you gain levels outside of this range before       redeeming your prize, you cannot be awarded your prize.    2) Only one person can attempt the Expedition at a time.  If you enter the       area to find it occupied (will be fairly obvious if this is the case),       you must leave and wait until the other player is finished.    3) Death within the Expedition is a very real possibility.  As it is a       personal challenge, no corpse retrievals will be allowed under any       circumstances.  If you die and can not recover your equipment yourself,       it will be forfeited.    4) If you are attempting the Expedition and you come upon a failed quester's       equipment, you must leave it alone.  Taking the equipment will be       considered corpse looting and be dealt with accordingly.    5) You are required to clean up your own messes.  Do not leave summoned       monsters or elementals behind.  If you brought them in, you have to take       them out before continuing with the Expedition.  They will not follow you       through the hatchways.    6) The Bronze Expedition is a solo endeavor.  You cannot receive material       aid of any kind within the challenge.  This includes the use of potions       brewed, scrolls scribed, or spells cast by another player.    7) As noted in Help Rules, you may not publically discuss the details of       this quest.  It is yours to complete, and yours to enjoy.     If you have read the above, including Help Rules, you may begin your Bronze Expedition by saying, "I understand."  If you are not ready to take the risk, you can return to the entry cavern by heading down the staircase. } {Bronze Expedition} {} {Inside} {} {1.000} {}
